Now, we know what you're thinking: "Why in the world would someone create a game like this?!" Well, dear reader, the answer is simple: boredom and obsession.

I was so obsessed with IU that I just had to create a game featuring her. And what better way to do it than to replace the boring old coins with images of her lovely face?

The game itself is pretty straightforward - flap your wings, avoid the obstacles, and collect those precious IU images. But I warn you, it's addictive. You might find yourself flapping away for hours on end, just to get that one elusive photo.

So go ahead, give IU Floppy Bird a try. You never know, you might just become a die-hard fan of both the game and the star herself. Happy flapping!
