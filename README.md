## Why IU?

Now, I know what you're thinking: "Why in the world would someone create a game like this?!" Well, dear reader, the answer is simple: boredom and obsession.

Now, You may ask "Who is IU?" Well, IU is a Korean pop star who has been in the music industry for over 10 years. She is known for her beautiful voice and her unique style. She has released many hit songs, including "Good Day", "Palette", and "BBIBBI". She has also starred in many popular dramas, including "Hotel Del Luna" and "My Mister".

*TLDR: IU is a cool person, and I like her*

## Why Floppy Bird?

I just wanted to try to make a simple game with Unity. Then I thought, "You know what would make this game better? IU.". So I added IU to the game. And that's how IU Floppy Bird was born.

So go ahead, give IU Floppy Bird a try. You never know, you might just become a die-hard fan of both the game and the star herself. Happy flapping!

*TLDR: I just wanted to make a game*
